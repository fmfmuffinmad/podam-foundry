It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the @action[Dodge] action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action.

You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,4\">chapter 5</a>, \"Equipment,\" in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for descriptions of these tools.</p><p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"3474\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Magic of Artifice</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @spell[cure wounds] using @item[alchemist's supplies|PHB], you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @item[tinker's tools|PHB], you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast @spell[poison spray], you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @spell[cure wounds] with @spell[heat metal], you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3475\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>.

If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the @spell[mending] spell is cast on it, it regains [[/r 2d6]] hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.</p><p>When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it.
