They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3552\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificers in Many Worlds</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war.

The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.</p><p>Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3553\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating an Artificer</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>To create an artificer, consult the subsections which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment.

If you cast it using @item[tinker's tools|PHB], you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds.

The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @spell[cure wounds] with @spell[heat metal], you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial.

Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificers in Many Worlds</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war.

The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.</p><p>Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable.
